## The Mission

Hey there future Aurory Frontend Developer! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a basic dapp that allows users to search our Aurorian NFTs, by trait(s), as described in the short video below:

## Getting started on your machine

The first step is to fork this repo so that a fork exists on your own GitHub account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version down onto your machine.

Install the repo's dependencies:

    $ yarn

Then start the local server:

    $ yarn dev

You should be able to see the app running on port `3000`

Please remember to:

- Commit often so we can see your progress.
- Use SolanaArt API.
- Use modern React APIs such as **hooks**.
- Utilize `tailwind` utility classes extensively (already integrated).
- Prefer `rem` over `px` for dimensions.
- Do not use any external components or npm dependencies.

## Objectives

- Ability to create complex responsive components from scratch.
- Have a understanding of modern React best practices.

## Deploy

Once done, publish a minified build of the project to [Surge](http://surge.sh) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and share the public URL.
To generate the build, run:

    $ yarn build

And then upload the generated `dist` folder. For example,

    $ surge -d my-project-url.surge.sh -p dist
